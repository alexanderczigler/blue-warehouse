BlueWarehouse
=============

"Atlassian Bamboo artifact deployer."

:: Background

BlueWarehouse is a very simple tool that will download an archive and unpack it to a folder. It can be used to download and deploy packages from build servers, especially to locations not accessible by them.

The program was written in 2010 and is adapted to work for Bamboo (Atlassian's build server software), however it can rather easily be expanded to download files from other servers as well.

It is not actively maintained but I put it on GitHub hoping someone might find it useful!
